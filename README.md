# markdown2html
This Project aims to provide the following functionality:

 - Create nice html Sites (Bootstrap Styled) from Markdown
 - Support for mermaid.js Diagrams in Markdown ( https://mermaid.js.org )
 - Support for Code Highlighting in sourcecode examples included in the markdown file. ( https://highlightjs.org )

Why am I doing this ?

Learning more about HTML, CSS, Markdown and Mermaid.
Having a nice static website without the overhead of hugo or any other static website framework.
